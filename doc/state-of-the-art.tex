\chapter{State of the art}
The techinique of
mixing real world elements with virtual elements displayed on the screen of a
device is what we call augmented reality. In the field of augmented reality, a
lot of things have happened during the last years. The progress in the fields
of computer vision and image processing have led to several new techniques of
detection and tracking. This, combined with the increasing availability of
powerful mobile devices, has enabled developers to build a plethora of high
quality AR-based applications. Nowadays, modern mobile devices use integrated
cameras, motion sensors and proximity sensors to make these AR-based experiences. 

Augmented reality in mobile devices is slightly different from what can be seen in
desktop environments. Although every year we have more powerful mobile smartphones
(citation needed), processing and drawing into the device's screen is still an
expensive operation in terms of computational cost. This is one of the reasons why
cost-efficient computer vision algorithms and techniques have emerged in the past
years. 

Most of the augmented reality apps follow this behaviour:
\begin{itemize}
\item Get the input from the camera or a video.
\item Search for an object of interest.
\item Introduce our object into the scene, considering the camera or the input position.
\end{itemize}

In this chapter we are going to describe which are the different techniques
that enables us to do them. 

%% In this chapter we are going to review several technologies that can bring augmented
%% reality to mobile or desktop apps.

%% \section{Computer vision}
%% Computer Vision is the field of computer science that allows to process and
%% analyze images. It's very related to machine vision and image processing. 

\section{Object recognition}
In order to provide an augmented reality experience, we have to know first
which is the real world element that we are going to use as a reference to mix
the real world input with our virtual elements. This reference can be from an
image from the smartphone camera to the user location. Ponster searches a
particular image inside the camera input in order to draw the poster image. In
computer vision, this is usually referred as object tracking. 

In computer vision there are a lot of object recognition techniques. In the
development of Ponster, two of these techniques have been tested: template
matching and feature-based detection.

\subsection{Template matching}

Template matching consists of finding areas of an image that are similar to a
provided template image.
