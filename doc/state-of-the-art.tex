\chapter{State of the art}
The techinique of
mixing real world elements with virtual elements displayed on the screen of a
device is what we call augmented reality. In the field of augmented reality, a
lot of things have happened during the last years. The progress in the fields
of computer vision and image processing have led to several new techniques of
detection and tracking. This, combined with the increasing availability of
powerful mobile devices, has enabled developers to build a plethora of high
quality AR-based applications. Nowadays, modern mobile devices use integrated
cameras, motion sensors and proximity sensors to make these AR-based experiences. 

Augmented reality in mobile devices is slightly different from what can be seen in
desktop environments. Although every year we have more powerful mobile smartphones
(citation needed), processing and drawing into the device's screen is still an
expensive operation in terms of computational cost. This is one of the reasons why
cost-efficient computer vision algorithms and techniques have emerged in the past
years. 

In this chapter we are going to review several technologies that can bring augmented
reality to mobile or desktop apps.
