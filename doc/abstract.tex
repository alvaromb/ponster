\chapter{Abstract}
Augmented reality has become a very popular topic in the last years. With
the introduction of mobile smartphones, and their increasing capability of
powerful CPUs and GPUs, developers started to have the chance
to build AR applications on these devices. Between all the computer vision
technologies available, OpenCV and Vuforia ---specifically built for mobile
devices--- are among the most used. In this work a comparison of this technologies
is made with the purpose of building a mobile application to enable users to see
virtual posters on their walls.
