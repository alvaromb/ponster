\chapter{Commercial applications and future work}
Building Ponster has been an oportunity to research how the computer vision field is
evolving and how other companies and institutions are using augmented reality to
build products and new techniques. 

In this chapter we are going to cite several applications that have served as an
inspiration to research about augmented reality and to build Ponster app. Also, we
are going to describe the future work.

\section{Commercial applications}
Speaking about mobile environments only, there are great commercial applications
that use augmented reality available to the major platforms. In this section we are
going to review a few applications that have served as an inspiration to Ponster.

\begin{description}
\item [SkyGuide] \hfill \\
SkyGuide is an augmented reality app that enables the user to identificate and get
information about the constellations that are present in the sky. This app uses the
user location and the gyroscope to get both where the user is located and how he is
moving the device. With this information, the application presents a view that
resembles to the night sky with all the information about the visible
constellations, planets and stars.

\item [IKEA] \hfill \\
The IKEA application also uses Vuforia SDK to bring quality augmented reality
experience to the mobile phone. Using the IKEA catalog as the object to track, users
can throw the catalogue to the floor and test how any furniture would look. The size
of the furniture is realistic because they know the exact sizes of the catalogue, so
they can easily determine at what size the objects must be rendered.

\item [Sony TV size] \hfill \\
This application enables users to test if a Sony TV is going to fit well in their
living room. They use a custom pattern that the user has to put where they want to
test the virtual television.

\item [LEGO Connect] \hfill \\
LEGO Connect also uses Vuforia to virtually enhace their product catalog. With a
LEGO product catalog, the user can identify any of the products displayed and draw a
virtual 3D model of any of their toys. These models can also be animated.
